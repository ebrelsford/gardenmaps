Perennials and shrubs are on the front line, but they do not obscure view into the garden. Clinging vines on the sides of the walls - A young apple tree in the center, 1 year old. This is the first time that a garden has been planted in this location. It has therefore been very challenging with getting the ground tilled from years of garbage, cars, debris, etc. Our garden has thrived and produced early in June and July because of unity in our endeavors.", "private events": ["no"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": ["basil"], "vegetables": ["beans", "cabbage", "cucumber", "eggplant", "jalape\u00f1o", "peas", "sweet peppers", "tomato", "winter squash"], "trees": ["1 apple"], "greens": ["collard", "kale"], "fruits": []}, "food use": ["used by growers"], "community_board": "3", "who composts": "", "other_plants": ["ornamental plantings and flowers", "shrubs"], "ownership": "NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation", "address": "9-11 Rochester Avenue", "composts currently": "no", "languages_spoken": "english, spanish", "borough": "Brooklyn", "id": "5111", "year_started": "2009", "art": [], "name": "Seasons of Vision", "open hours": "", "structures": ["pathways", "playground", "rainwater catchment system", "raised beds", "seating area"], "previous_use": " vacant lot ", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "76-100%", "surveyed": true, "water features": ["water pump"], "volunteers needed": "no", "fences": "chain link", "events": ["religious activities"]}
