{"website": "", "council_district": "7", "neighborhood": "Washington Heights", "description": "The Dorothy McGowan Memorial Garden provides a quiet place to sit and relax in Washington Heights.  Dorothy was a dedicated community activist (with Community League) who convinced the Trust for Public Land and CENYC to provide technical and material support.  Her guiding hand created a renewed space with vegetable beds, ornamental plants, bluestone pathways, an arbor, and flagstone patio interlaid with bricks. Local residents also built wood tables and benches.  Children from local schools come for Easter egg hunts and other activities. Originally called the League Garden; Dorothy lived to see the completion of this open space that now bears her name.", "private events": [], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": [], "vegetables": [], "trees": [], "greens": [], "fruits": []}, "food use": [], "community_board": "12", "who composts": "", "other_plants": [], "ownership": "TPL", "address": "509 W. 158th Street", "composts currently": "no", "languages_spoken": "spanish", "borough": "Manhattan", "id": "1020", "year_started": "", "art": [], "name": "Dorothy K.
