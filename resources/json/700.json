It was bigger, then smaller, then bigger again, and now takes up a whole lot. It was often attacked in the past, plants destroyed, by those wanting to keep it a parking lot. It serves a very diverse community, and our board and membership are also diverse. The Slope is one of the few things in the area to have been beautified without local communities being pushed out of the process. Much in the area has been gentrified, meaning working people and communities of color have been excluded and victimized by the changes. This has not been the case with the evolution of the Slope. Ours is a very open and democratic culture.", "private events": ["members and non-members", "reservation & rental fee", "yes"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": [], "vegetables": [], "trees": ["2 apple", "1 cherry", "1 pear"], "greens": [], "fruits": ["grape"]}, "food use": ["used by growers"], "community_board": "3", "who composts": "", "other_plants": ["ornamental plantings and flowers", "shade trees", "shrubs"], "ownership": "NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation", "address": "626-27 E. 5th Street", "composts currently": "no", "languages_spoken": "chinese, english, spanish", "borough": "Manhattan", "id": "700", "year_started": "1988", "art": [], "name": "Fifth Street Slope Children's Garden", "open hours": "MTWRFSSu 10am-6pm", "structures": ["grill", "pathways", "seating area", "table(s)", "toolshed"], "previous_use": "abandoned building,  vacant lot - going back say 30 years, it was marsh land. they say there was building there, then it was a lot.", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "yes", "perceived edibility": "0-25%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "no", "fences": "chain link", "events": ["barbecues", "movies", "picnics"]}
