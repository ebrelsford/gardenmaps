We began as a group organizing to rid the Sara Roosevelt Park area of drugs and crime and to protect low-income housing in the neighborhood. PS M130 children, the Rivington Houses AIDs Hospice and Echoprosocial children's mosaic sculptures have garden plots, and Marte Valle Jr. High School children created mosaic stepping stones for the children's area.
