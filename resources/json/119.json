The community garden area has plots, and portico to keep out of the rain and have meetings and community events.  A raised deck surrounds a weepiing willow tree for quiet observation. The park has a small meadow, small woodland, and an undeveloped children's area. Diverse fruiting shrubs and tress throughout. The parks most unique feature is its feeling of seclusion and wilderness. Its unmanicured look gives one the feeling they are in the country.  Visitors often spend hours relaxing and enjoying the plant and wildlife diversity. Guests are welcome during open hours.
