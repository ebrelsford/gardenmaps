Our group started cleaning up vacant lots and establishing the gardens by building beds, building boxes, and planting seeds. Today, we are free from the drug dealing and prostitution going on here. We have a beautiful community garden where school children come to do their homework and learn about gardening. The garden brings the neighborhood together to sponsor community activities such as a block party and festivals, and programs such as health and nutrition programs and athletic games.", "private events": ["informal", "yes"], "waitlist": "yes", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "chamomile", "chive", "cilantro", "comfrey", "dill", "fennel", "lavender", "lemongrass", "lleva buena", "marjoram", "mint", "oregano", "parsley", "sage", "thyme"], "vegetables": ["asparagus", "beans", "beet", "broccoli", "brussell sprouts", "cabbage", "carrot", "cauliflower", "corn", "cucumber", "eggplant", "garlic", "onion", "peas", "potato", "pumpkin", "radish", "scallion", "summer squash", "sweet peppers", "tomato", "winter squash"], "trees": ["1 apple", "1 apricot", "1 peach"], "greens": ["chard", "collard", "kale", "lettuce"], "fruits": ["bitter melon", "blueberry", "cantaloupe", "grape", "strawberry", "watermelon"]}, "food use": ["donated", "sold", "used by growers"], "community_board": "11", "who composts": "public", "other_plants": ["native plant garden", "ornamental plantings and flowers", "shade trees", "shrubs"], "ownership": "HPD", "address": "1761 Park Avenue", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "english", "borough": "Manhattan", "id": "717", "year_started": "1993", "art": [], "name": "Jackie Robinson Community Garden", "open hours": "", "structures": ["grill", "pathways", "rainwater catchment system", "raised beds", "seating area", "toolshed"], "previous_use": "abandoned building, vacant lot ", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "yes", "perceived edibility": "76-100%", "surveyed": true, "water features": ["water pump"], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "chain link", "events": ["arts & crafts", "barbecues", "educational events", "picnics", "private events", "religious activities", "workshops"]}
