{"website": "", "council_district": "8", "neighborhood": "East Harlem", "description": " This is a special ornamental garden in East Harlem, a collaboration of Hope Community and CENYC.  You enter the front area and a small foot bridge greets you on the right.  It traverses a concrete stream that once carried water from a textured mural depicting a jungle waterfall but now is home to a family of turtles.  A narrow brick pathway leads the visitor to different sitting areas. Mature birch trees provide dappled shade.  A private reading garden used for poetry readings can be found in the back.", "private events": [], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": [], "vegetables": [], "trees": [], "greens": [], "fruits": []}, "food use": [], "community_board": "11", "who composts": "", "other_plants": [], "ownership": "Private", "address": "Lexington Ave", "composts currently": "no", "languages_spoken": "spanish", "borough": "Manhattan", "id": "113", "year_started": "", "art": [], "name": "Hope Community's Modesto \"Tin\" Flores Garden", "open hours": "unposted", "structures": [], "previous_use": "", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "", "surveyed": false, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "no", "fences": "", "events": []}
