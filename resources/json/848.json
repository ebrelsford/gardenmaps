After two years we began working with Green Thumb who assisted our ongoing work with supplies and materials and assisted us in transferring the lot to the Parks Dept. Newly installed water tank thanks to GrowNYC! The garden is a friendly place to hang out, and is split between communal garden and 16 raised beds for growing vegetables or flowers.", "private events": ["no"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "chive", "cilantro", "dill", "fennel", "lavender", "marjoram", "mint", "oregano", "parsley", "sage", "thyme"], "vegetables": ["cucumber", "garlic", "parsnip", "radish", "scallion", "sweet peppers", "tomato", "turnip"], "trees": ["1 cherry"], "greens": ["arugula", "chard", "collard", "kale", "lettuce"], "fruits": ["grape", "strawberry"]}, "food use": ["used by growers"], "community_board": "6", "who composts": "garden members only", "other_plants": ["ornamental plantings and flowers", "shade trees"], "ownership": "NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation", "address": "261-265 Columbia Street", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "english", "borough": "Brooklyn", "id": "848", "year_started": "1996", "art": [], "name": "Amazing Garden", "open hours": "W 9am-6pm, SSu 10am-6pm", "structures": ["grill", "rainwater catchment system", "raised beds", "seating area", "table(s)", "toolshed"], "previous_use": " vacant lot ", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "26-50%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "iron", "events": ["barbecues", "movies", "picnics"]}
