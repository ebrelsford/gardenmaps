{"website": "http://www.nyrp.org/communitygarden", "council_district": "41", "neighborhood": "", "description": "The Bedford-Stuyvesant Community Garden, formerly the Lola Bryant Community Garden, had long been known for the large quantities of fruits and vegetables, including collard greens, tomatoes, okra and pole and bush beans, that were cultivated there for many years by avid local gardeners and shared with senior citizens and others in the community. Then, in 2006, Dr. Leslie Dae Johnson, a forensic geneticist and New York Restoration Project (NYRP) patron, made a generous gift to not only restore and revitalize the site, but also to endow the garden's ongoing maintenance. The garden's unconventional amenities include trellises constructed from glu-lam a material typically used in telephone and communication infrastructures, which provide space for grapes and vines to grow and flourish. NYRP also created concrete pavers from recycled pieces of sidewalk and installed them as stepping stones throughout the garden. The space also features the extensive use of green walls, a boardwalk constructed from recycled materials, picnic tables, permeable-paved surfaces and a rainwater collection system sourced from the rooftop of a neighboring building.", "private events": ["informal", "members and non-members", "reservation & rental fee", "reservation only", "yes"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "cilantro", "dill", "lavender", "parsley", "sage", "thyme"], "vegetables": ["beans", "cucumber", "eggplant", "onion", "peas", "radish", "sweet peppers", "tomato"], "trees": ["4 apple", "1 peach"], "greens": ["collard", "kale", "lettuce", "mesclun"], "fruits": []}, "food use": ["used by growers"], "community_board": "3", "who composts": "garden members & neighborhood residents", "other_plants": ["ornamental plantings and flowers"], "ownership": "NYRP", "address": "", "composts currently": "no", "languages_spoken": "arabic, english, hindi, spanish", "borough": "Brooklyn", "id": "5088", "year_started": "1988", "art": [], "name": "Bedford Stuyvesant Community Garden", "open hours": "MTWRFSSu 9am-8pm", "structures": ["pathways", "rainwater catchment system", "raised beds", "seating area", "table(s)", "toolshed"], "previous_use": "park, vacant lot ", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "51-75%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "iron", "events": ["arts & crafts", "barbecues", "educational events", "picnics", "private events", "workshops"]}
