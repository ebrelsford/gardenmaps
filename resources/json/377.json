The garden volunteers sponsor a block party every year that is attended by hundreds of community residents and children.  The gardeners also participate in Neighborhood Watch programs and serve on the 44th Precinct Community Council. Due to their careful stewardship of the garden and the block, Sherman Avenue Association was able to have street trees planted on their street.  The garden serves children from P.S. 166 and several day care centers and also serves as a gathering space for area senior citizens.  This garden has the support of community board four to remain as a permanent garden site.", "private events": [], "waitlist": "yes", "food": {"herbs": [], "vegetables": [], "trees": [], "greens": [], "fruits": []}, "food use": [], "community_board": "4", "who composts": "", "other_plants": [], "ownership": "TPL", "address": "957 Sherman Ave.", "composts currently": "no", "languages_spoken": "spanish", "borough": "Bronx", "id": "377", "year_started": "", "art": [], "name": "Sherman Avenue Association", "open hours": "M-Sun 10:00am-6L00pm", "structures": [], "previous_use": "", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "", "surveyed": false, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "no", "fences": "", "events": []}
