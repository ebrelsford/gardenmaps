{"website": "", "council_district": "34", "neighborhood": "Williamsburg", "description": "The garden was founded by a woman who got tired of seeing garbage being dumped in the vacant lot.  As the garden was developing, houses were being built across the street.  There was a time when people did not dare to walk along this section of Mckibben Street regardless of the hour.  I'm told there was not even a fire hydrant  and I recall a time when there was no sidewalk. Outside there are two Linden trees and inside we have 15 vegetable beds and several flower beds as well as grapes, peaches, nectarines and figs.  The focal point is a swing with a trelis of roses.  There's also a rainwater harvesting system with a five-hundred gallon tank.  One very special feature of our garden is the Star of David childrens bed located at the entrance.", "private events": ["members and non-members", "reservation only", "yes"], "waitlist": "yes", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "chamomile", "cilantro", "dill", "echinacea", "fennel", "lavender", "marjoram", "mint", "oregano", "parsley", "sage", "thyme"], "vegetables": ["beans", "beet", "broccoli", "cabbage", "carrot", "cauliflower", "cayenne", "celery", "corn", "cucumber", "eggplant", "garlic", "haba\u00f1ero", "jalape\u00f1o", "onion", "peas", "potato", "pumpkin", "radish", "scallion", "summer squash", "sweet peppers", "tomato", "turnip", "winter squash"], "trees": ["1 fig", "1 mulberry", "1 nectarine", "3 peach"], "greens": ["arugula", "bok choy", "chard", "collard", "endive", "kale", "lettuce", "mesclun", "spinach"], "fruits": ["bitter melon", "blackberry", "cantaloupe", "grape", "raspberry", "strawberry", "watermelon"]}, "food use": ["donated", "used by growers"], "community_board": "1", "who composts": "garden members & neighborhood residents", "other_plants": ["native plant garden", "ornamental plantings and flowers", "shade trees", "shrubs"], "ownership": "NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation", "address": "99-100 McKibben Street", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "english, spanish", "borough": "Brooklyn", "id": "706", "year_started": "1991", "art": [], "name": "Sunshine Community Garden", "open hours": "MTWRFSSu 9am-7pm", "structures": ["grill", "pathways", "rainwater catchment system", "raised beds", "seating area", "table(s)", "toolshed"], "previous_use": " vacant lot ", "works with schools": "yes", "dues": "yes", "perceived edibility": "51-75%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "iron", "events": ["arts & crafts", "barbecues", "educational events", "private events", "religious activities", "workshops"]}
