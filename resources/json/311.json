The Council runs the East Harlem\ufffds Head Start program and have integrated gardening into the children\ufffds regular curriculum. Gardening provides the teachers with an ongoing, outdoor, hands-on activity that is perfect for the summer months when, unlike schools, the Head Start program is still in session.

They have begun construction for this season, which will include repairing the summerhouse and building raised beds. Community board eleven has issued a statement opposing the auction of this garden.
