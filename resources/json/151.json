While the garden traces its origins as a GreenThumb garden back to 1981, it is beginning its third season of an extensive preservation and revitalization program that has transformed a blighted and deteriorating space into an attractive oasis of flowers, vegetables, shrubs, fruit bearing trees, and garden beds and furnishings. The garden serves a diverse poplation in transition, consisting of native born New Yorkers, migrants from across the country, and immigrants, primarily from the Caribbean, all of whom reflect a microcosm of Central Brooklyn. These residents span the ages from seniors to infants and represent the able bodied and the mentally and physically disabled. They also comprise the gamut of socio-economic strata from middle class professionals, skilled technicians, service workers, the working poor, and the indigent. The garden built itself around partnering and existing community agencies and organization to bring people and resources together and to design and develop an environmentally attractive and sound green open space.", "private events": ["members only (no non-members can rent garden)", "yes"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "dill", "parsley", "thyme"], "vegetables": ["beans", "beet", "broccoli", "cabbage", "cucumber", "eggplant", "summer squash", "tomato"], "trees": ["1 apple", "1 cherry", "1 mulberry", "1 peach"], "greens": ["collard", "lettuce", "spinach"], "fruits": []}, "food use": ["donated", "used by growers"], "community_board": "3", "who composts": "garden members only", "other_plants": ["ornamental plantings and flowers", "shade trees", "shrubs"], "ownership": "NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation", "address": "397-401 Quincy St.", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "english, spanish", "borough": "Brooklyn", "id": "151", "year_started": "2001", "art": ["mural"], "name": "First Quincy Street Community Garden", "open hours": "MTWR 3pm-5pm, F 2pm-4pm, Su 12pm-3pm", "structures": ["gazebo/casita", "pathways", "rainwater catchment system", "raised beds", "table(s)", "toolshed"], "previous_use": "vacant lot", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "26-50%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "no", "fences": "chain link", "events": ["arts & crafts", "barbecues", "educational events", "workshops"]}
