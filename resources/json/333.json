The gazebo and seating area are equipped with overhead misting jets to make hot summer days bearable! This is an active garden with a friendly, diverse gardenership and regular events (in season). The front area is a colorful cottage garden with natural log borders running alongside a new stone walkway that leads past a wooden gazebo to the garden's central section, which contains a pergola/seating area, individual gardeners' beds, and an herb garden. At the rear of the space is a shade/fern garden underneath an unique shade structure, a barbecue patio, a tool shed, and the garden's composting program area.", "private events": ["members and non-members", "yes"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "chive", "cilantro", "echinacea", "lavender", "marjoram", "mint", "oregano", "parsley", "sage", "thyme"], "vegetables": ["asparagus", "beans", "beet", "broccoli", "cucumber", "eggplant", "garlic", "jalape\u00f1o", "onion", "peas", "radish", "scallion", "sweet peppers", "tomato"], "trees": [], "greens": ["arugula", "chard", "collard"], "fruits": ["blackberry", "grape", "raspberry"]}, "food use": ["used by growers"], "community_board": "4", "who composts": "garden members & neighborhood residents", "other_plants": ["native plant garden", "ornamental plantings and flowers", "shrubs"], "ownership": "TPL", "address": "146 Woodbine Street", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "", "borough": "Brooklyn", "id": "333", "year_started": "1977", "art": [], "name": "Woodbine Street Block Association", "open hours": "", "structures": ["educational signs", "gazebo/casita", "grill", "pathways", "raised beds", "seating area", "table(s)", "toolshed"], "previous_use": "abandoned building  ", "works with schools": "yes", "dues": "yes", "perceived edibility": "26-50%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "no", "fences": "iron", "events": ["arts & crafts", "barbecues", "concerts", "educational events", "performance", "private events", "workshops"]}
