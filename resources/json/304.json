It was originally maintained by a collection of gardeners that, as they aged and became unable to care for the garden, passed it on to a new collective. As the transition took place, there were several instances of vandalism in the garden, which posed problems of community cooperation that the new gardeners worked through to get the garden where it is now. The uniqueness of our garden is that we are still trying to provide a safe, beautiful, and nautral space in our neighborhood out of a burnt house and lot. The founders found a need to raise from ashes beauty and give hope to a troubled community. We have flower beds on each side of the gazebo and two barrels to catch the rain water from the roof of the gazebo. Toward the back we have eight medium height, raised garden beds (which are used by the garden members to grow vegetables, fruits, and edible flowers).", "private events": ["informal", "members and non-members", "reservation only", "yes"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "chive", "cilantro", "dill", "echinacea", "lavender", "mint", "parsley", "sage", "thyme"], "vegetables": ["beans", "broccoli", "brussell sprouts", "cabbage", "cauliflower", "celery", "cucumber", "eggplant", "jalape\u00f1o", "onion", "radish", "scallion", "sweet peppers", "tomato"], "trees": ["1 cherry"], "greens": ["arugula", "bok choy", "collard", "kale", "lamb's quarters", "lettuce", "mesclun"], "fruits": ["elderberry", "grape", "raspberry", "strawberry", "watermelon"]}, "food use": ["donated", "used by growers"], "community_board": "12", "who composts": "garden members only", "other_plants": ["native plant garden", "shade trees", "shrubs"], "ownership": "TPL", "address": "144-27 Lakewood Ave.", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "arabic, english, french, hindi, spanish", "borough": "Queens", "id": "304", "year_started": "1984", "art": ["mural", "sculpture(s)"], "name": "Back to Eden", "open hours": "MW 9am-2pm, F 3pm-7pm", "structures": ["educational signs", "gazebo/casita", "grill", "rainwater catchment system", "raised beds", "seating area", "table(s)", "toolshed"], "previous_use": "vacant,  burnt lot", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "yes", "perceived edibility": "26-50%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "", "events": ["arts & crafts", "barbecues", "concerts", "educational events", "performance", "picnics", "private events", "workshops"]}
