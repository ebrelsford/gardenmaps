In 2004, New York Restoration Project (NYRP) installed an iron picket fence to ensure the garden was protected, built a sidewalk and began actively recruiting new neighbors and community institutions to help plant and enjoy this green space. Then, in 2008, NYRP built picnic tables and benches and partnered with local gardeners to install raised planting beds. Additional garden features include a winding woodchip path bordered by flowers and perennials, such as a raspberry bush, several mature rose bushes and a beautiful Magnolia tree.", "private events": ["informal", "members and non-members", "reservation & rental fee", "reservation only", "yes"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": ["basil"], "vegetables": ["beans", "onion", "peas", "radish", "sweet peppers", "tomato"], "trees": [], "greens": ["arugula", "collard", "kale", "lettuce"], "fruits": []}, "food use": ["used by growers"], "community_board": "4", "who composts": "garden members only", "other_plants": ["ornamental plantings and flowers", "shade trees"], "ownership": "NYRP", "address": "974 Madison Street", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "english", "borough": "Brooklyn", "id": "319", "year_started": "1999", "art": [], "name": "Madison Street Community Garden", "open hours": "T 4pm-7pm, W 4pm-6pm, S 12pm-7pm, Su 11am-7pm", "structures": ["grill", "pathways", "raised beds", "seating area"], "previous_use": " vacant lot ", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "51-75%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "iron", "events": ["barbecues", "picnics"]}
