Winding paths lead through the garden and up steps, past retaining walls. We are so fortunate to have such a beautiful garden. Old members get along with new. We consider ourselves stewards of the land and stress a responsibility and accountability to the public. One of our gardeners loves to tell people, \"It doesn't \"take a village,\" it takes a garden.\" Another says, \"'Garden' is a verb.\" Greening our urban environment is what it's all about, and our tomatoes are excellent!", "private events": ["no"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "chamomile", "chive", "cilantro", "comfrey", "dill", "echinacea", "fennel", "horseradish", "lavendar", "lemongrass", "marjoram", "mint", "oregano", "parsley", "sage", "thyme"], "vegetables": ["artichoke", "beans", "beet", "broccoli", "brussell sprouts", "cabbage", "carrot", "cayenne", "cucumber", "eggplant", "garlic", "jalape\u00f1o", "onion", "parsnip", "peas", "potato", "pumpkin", "radish", "scallion", "summer squash", "sweet peppers", "tomato", "turnip", "winter squash"], "trees": ["1 apple", "1 fig", "1 peach"], "greens": ["amaranth", "arugula", "chard", "collard", "kale", "lettuce", "mache", "mesclun", "spinach"], "fruits": ["blackberry", "blueberry", "cantaloupe", "elderberry", "gooseberry", "raspberry", "rhubarb", "strawberry", "watermelon"]}, "food use": ["donated", "used by growers"], "community_board": "8", "who composts": "public", "other_plants": ["native plant garden", "ornamental plantings", "shade trees", "shrubs"], "ownership": "TPL", "address": "252-256 St. Marks Avenue", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "english, french, japanese, portuguese", "borough": "Brooklyn", "id": "1062", "year_started": "1996", "art": [], "name": "Prospect Heights Community Farm", "open hours": "T,W: 4-6PM, Th,F: 5-7PM, Sat/Sun: 12-6PM", "structures": ["grill", "pathways", "rainwater catchment", "raised beds", "seating area", "table(s)", "toolshed"], "previous_use": "burned-down building", "works with schools": "yes", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "26-50%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "iron", "events": ["barbecues", "educational events", "performance", "picnics", "workshops"]}
