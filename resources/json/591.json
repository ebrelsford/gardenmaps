Over the past seven years, 2,200 CSSP participants have worked 7,150 hours to create and maintain the garden.  In the summer, mostly senior citizens, plant trees, flowers and vegetables in the garden.  Youth who participate in CEP (Court Employment Project) plant in the garden as well.  This summer, the Education Unit at CASES plans to use the garden in a series of lessons about herbal medicine. The garden is home to a beautiful mosaic mural created with the leadership of CASES young people last summer.
