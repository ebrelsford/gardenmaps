This beautifully manicured, 2,000-square-foot garden is a peaceful oasis for the surrounding neighborhood, which is situated in an area where residents suffer from asthma rates more than double the citywide average. This vital green space features a meandering grass path bordered by stones and shade trees. Garden plantings focus primarily on ornamental flowers and shrubs, which are tended by a garden group organized by the Missionaries of Charity.", "private events": ["informal", "members and non-members", "reservation & rental fee", "reservation only", "yes"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": [], "vegetables": [], "trees": [], "greens": [], "fruits": []}, "food use": [], "community_board": "4", "who composts": "", "other_plants": ["botanical garden", "ornamental plantings and flowers", "shade trees", "shrubs"], "ownership": "NYRP", "address": "Aberdeen Street between Bushwick and Broadway", "composts currently": "no", "languages_spoken": "arabic, chinese, creole, english, hindi, italian, spanish", "borough": "Brooklyn", "id": "5102", "year_started": "1999", "art": ["sculpture(s)"], "name": "Infant Jesus Garden", "open hours": "MTWRFSSu 10am-6pm", "structures": ["pathways", "seating area"], "previous_use": " vacant lot ", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "0-25%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "chain link", "events": ["religious activities"]}
