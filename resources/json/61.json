The garden members are mostly senior citizens. Squash, raspberries and pumpkins are grown and distributed throughout the community.  In fact, over 300 pounds of sweet potatoes were grown last year alone.  This once rubble-strewn vacant lot now has a sitting area complete with brick foot paths, picnic tables, benches and barbeque pit.  This garden has the support of community board 13 to remain a permanent garden site.
