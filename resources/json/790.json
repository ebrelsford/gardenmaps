It contains decorative plantings of flowers and vegetables and several large trees.  The garden is used as a recreation space by local children.  The gardeners provide workout equipment and other recreational opportunities for the kids.  Children designed and painted two murals in the garden.  The garden provides much needed recreation space for local youth who, although they live adjacent to a large Bronx green space, are excluded from using it by the admission fees of the Bronx Zoo.
