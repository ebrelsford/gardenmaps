{"website": "", "council_district": "7", "neighborhood": "Washington Heights", "description": "This is a very large garden with several large mulberry trees (that attract an assortment of birds), a large old pear tree that seniors in the neighborhood remember from their youth, and ample benches and tables that remain from when the garden was an interim park during the Koch administration. A unique aspect of this garden is a tranquility that cannot be imagined or experience unless you are in it.  The largest part of EAGPS is hidden from the street view.  Because of a steep slope to get up into the park, the average passerby cannot see up into the larger part of the park.  A unique part of our history is that we won our garden license during a moritorium Mayor Guilliani had declared on any new Green Thumb licenses.  Prior to that hurdle, we had to appeal to the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development to to have the garden lot transferred to the Parks Department.", "private events": ["members and non-members", "reservation & rental fee", "yes"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": [], "vegetables": [], "trees": ["1 pear"], "greens": [], "fruits": []}, "food use": [], "community_board": "9", "who composts": "", "other_plants": ["native plant garden", "ornamental plantings and flowers", "shade trees"], "ownership": "NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation", "address": "339-341 Edgecomb Ave.", "composts currently": "no", "languages_spoken": "english, spanish", "borough": "Manhattan", "id": "1174", "year_started": "1995", "art": [], "name": "Edgecombe Avenue Garden Park Sanctuary", "open hours": "MTWRF 3pm-6pm, SSu 10am-6pm", "structures": ["pathways", "seating area", "table(s)"], "previous_use": " vacant lot", "works with schools": "yes", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "0-25%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "other (please specify)", "events": ["educational events", "private events"]}
