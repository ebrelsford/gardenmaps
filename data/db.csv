The garden's unconventional amenities include trellises constructed from glu-lam a material typically used in telephone and communication infrastructures, which provide space for grapes and vines to grow and flourish. NYRP also created concrete pavers from recycled pieces of sidewalk and installed them as stepping stones throughout the garden.

The garden was originally founded as a Memorial Garden for Veterans by a group of retired servicemen in the neighborhood.

The dedicated local residents of the East Fourth Street Garden Association have tended this site, formerly known as the Windsor Terrace Kensington Veterans Memorial Garden, since they first organized it in 1979.

The East Fourth Street garden has funded its operations and special projects through dues collection, flea markets, and two Mollie Parnis Dress Up Your Neighborhood Awards. In addition, the garden also welcomes visitors for a series of special events and workshops, such as Jazz concerts and Fall Harvest Festivals.

While the garden traces its origins as a GreenThumb garden back to 1981, it is beginning its third season of an extensive preservation and revitalization program that has transformed a blighted and deteriorating space into an attractive oasis of flowers, vegetables, shrubs, fruit bearing trees, and garden beds and furnishings. The garden serves a diverse poplation in transition, consisting of native born New Yorkers, migrants from across the country, and immigrants, primarily from the Caribbean, all of whom reflect a microcosm of Central Brooklyn. These residents span the ages from seniors to infants and represent the able bodied and the mentally and physically disabled. They also comprise the gamut of socio-economic strata from middle class professionals, skilled technicians, service workers, the working poor, and the indigent. The garden built itself around partnering and existing community agencies and organization to bring people and resources together and to design and develop an environmentally attractive and sound green open space.","GrowNYC Community Garden Survey 2009/2010","Vacant Lot","NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation","Yes","26-50%","Used by growers","Donated",,,,"Tomato",,,"Summer Squash",,"Cucumber","Broccoli",,"Beet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cabbage",,,,"Beans","Eggplant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Collard",,,,"Lettuce",,"Spinach",,,1,1,1,,,1,,,,,,"Basil",,,,,"Dill",,,,,,,,,,,"Parsley",,"Thyme",,"Shade Trees","Ornamental Plantings and Flowers",,"Shrubs",,,,"Yes",,,,"Garden members only",,,,"Toolshed",,,,"Gazebo/Casita",,"Raised Beds","Rainwater Catchment System","Pathways",,,"Mural","Table(s)",,,,"911 Firemen's memorial monument and memorial bench for deceased garden members","Chain Link",,,,,,,,"Workshops","Arts & Crafts",,,,"Educational Events","Barbecues",,,,,,,"Annual spring clean-up and cook-out, annual membership drive campaign, 2009 Summer lunch ""Nutritional Snack Pack Substitutes: Bridging the Gap between Deprivation and Hunger""","Yes","Members only (no non-members can rent garden)",,,,,,"No",,,,,,"Nothing yet, but we would like to",,"No",,,,"Nothing yet, but we would like to","Not at present, but is exploring the possibility of doing so with the local Interagency Council of the Aging.",,"No","While our garden has an impressive membership roster, we only have a handful of members that are hands-on.

In 1992, a group of young people, many of whom were artists, began a year long cleanup in an undeveloped lot. This was the beginning of a garden made unique and distinguished by its careful planning, varied plantings, and active artistic programming. The name was a spontaneous suggestion early in the process that caught everyone's imagination, and soon came to symbolize the aesthetic goals of the gardening group. The Human Compass Garden, on the corner of Sackett and Columbia Streets in Brooklyn, has continued to grow and develop over the years, attracting the interest and contributions of an ever-growing number of Columbia Street Waterfront District residents.  The enchanting garden made the perfect setting for a series of outdoor art exhibitions showcasing the work of local artists, presented over the summers of 1994 and 1995. In 1996, the garden coordinators introduced the,Art in the Garden��_� program, with the help of grants from the Trust for Public Land and the Brooklyn Arts Council (BACA).,Art in the Garden,��_� an array of weekend classes and workshops in many techniques, continues to delight neighborhood children and their families. The garden has also hosted,Reels on Wheels,��_� a Friday evening film series, and community potluck suppers.  The Human Compass Garden serves as a forum for an active political organization as well. One of four in a neighborhood coalition known as the Columbia Waterfront Gardens, the caretakers of this site work with local community boards and elected officials to protect green space and expand neighborhood activism and arts programming. Columbia Waterfront Gardens coalition is dedicated to making the gardens community assets. Human Compass and its counterparts, the Summit Street Garden, Amazing Garden, and the Backyard, were all created with the aid of GreenThumb, a City-sponsored organization for community gardening. All four were transferred to the protective jurisdiction of Parks in 1998, but they continue to be maintained by their community organizers. Many non-profit organizations, including the Trust for Public Land and the Hudson River Foundation, have offered generous support for the maintenance and improvement of the garden.  Reclaimed red bricks define the shape of the hilly beds on the outer edge of the space. These beds, filled with more than two dozen trees and countless shade plants, encircle a sheltered green refuge. The inner garden has wooden picnic tables, a shed, a wood chip floor, and grills, with benches, fancy chairs, and sculpture tucked into every corner. The sunniest spot holds a rose garden. Gardeners and visitors alike enjoy the harmony and restful atmosphere created by meticulous care and thoughtful planning.","GrowNYC Community Garden Survey 2009/2010"," Vacant Lot ","NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation","Yes","0-25%",,,,,"we have an apple tree, grape vine, and Mulberry tree, and anyone in the garden may enjoy the fruit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"mint",,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mint",,,,,,"Shade Trees","Ornamental Plantings and Flowers",,"Shrubs","Native Plant Garden",,,"Yes",,,"Only leaves and vegetation from the garden, no food stuff is composted","Garden members only",,,,"Toolshed",,,"Seating Area",,"Educational Signs",,,,,,,"Table(s)","Sculpture(s)",,,,"Iron",,,,,,,"existing structures are in good condition","Workshops","Arts & Crafts",,"Picnics",,"Educational Events","Barbecues","Concerts",,,"Private Events",,,,"Yes",,"Members and non-members","Reservation only","Reservation & rental fee",,"$25 dollar donation to the garden","No",,,,,,,,"Yes","Garden workshops",,"Educational events",,,"Greenthumb  Carroll Gardens Association","Yes",

Tall trees are kept pruned to maximize light on personal gardening plots at the garden's center. Self-sowing violets, queen-anne's-lace, coneflower, black-eyed-susan, asters, etc., contribute to the vitality of the garden.

The garden is managed holistically and tended communally by an ever-changing but deeply committed group of gardeners. The site is what remains of a private backyard taken over for highway construction and then left as a dumpsite.  Old apple trees and antique roses remain from earlier times, and a thorny honey locust grew from seed. Other woody plants, including a pagoda dogwood, were put in randomly by city workers.  In the 80's, neighbors cleared the debris and planted lawn grass, which then reverted to a solid mass of mugwort and other weeds in the 90's.  Since 1997, gardeners have removed weeds, shaped the terrain and pathways, and installed many many plants of edible, ornamental, and/or ecological value while continually amending the silty fill soil.

Guided through a participatory planning process by Heifer International, the Committee developed a vision and outlined a plan to address food insecurity, unemployment, and the alienation of youth from the Red Hook community. Since then, we have developed a youth lead movement for local food security, opened two farmers' markets, an urban CSA, and developed a 2.75 acre farm in Red Hook and piloted a number of Food and Farm Based Learning Initiatives (FFBL). In August 2003, Added Value partnered with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation to transform an entire city block from a dilapidated playground into a center for urban agriculture. Now Red Hook Community Farm is a vibrant community resource where young and old work, study and grow together as they sow, nurture and harvest plants on a 2.75 acre urban farm. It is an intergenerational community space that serves as an experiential educational environment for youth, adults and our senior citizens. It provides sustenance to residents, creates meaningful work for neighborhood teens, generates thousands of dollars of economic activity and improves community food security. Since opening Red Hook Community Farm (RHCF) in 2005 we have worked closely with our local elementary schools, Public School 27 (PS27), the Brooklyn New School (BNS) and Public School 15 (PS15), to first pilot, then implement a number of FFBLs including our Farm-To-Classroom program and our Seed-to-Salad projects.
