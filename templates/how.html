    <body>
        Select items from the right side bar that you would like to view. The first one you click will fill in the <span class="yellow">yellow</span> box, and the second will fill in the <span class="red">red</span> box. The <span class="orange">orange</span> box will show you any overlap. To change which items you are comparing, click the <span class="delete"></span> in the top right corner of the <span class="yellow">yellow</span> or <span class="red">red</span> box.
        <br /><br />
        For example, if you click <span class="trigger">art</span>, then <span class="trigger">mural</span>, all surveyed gardens with murals will be highlighted with <span class="yellow">yellow</span>. Then, if you click <span class="trigger">volunteers</span> followed by <span class="trigger">hosts volunteers</span>, all surveyed gardens that host volunteers will be highlighted in <span class="red">red</span>. All surveyed gardens with murals that also host volunteers will appear in <span class="orange">orange</span>. If you now decide that you are no longer interested in murals, you can click the <span class="delete"></span> next to 'mural' on the left.
