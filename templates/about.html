            Community gardens provide flowers, food, education, social benefits, and much more. Created to provide New York residents and community developers with more information about the activities and features of each community garden, this GardenMaps charts out the results of a 2009-2010 survey by Mara Gittleman and Lenny Librizzi to support the work of <a href="http://www.grownyc.org/">GrowNYC</a> and <a href="http://greenthumbnyc.org/">GreenThumb</a>. 
            <br /><br />
            The survey was designed to update GrowNYC's central database of community gardens, update the <a href="http://www.oasisnyc.net/">OASIS</a> map, and create new datasets around issues like food production and partnerships with schools. For more information and/or to access the shapefile used in this map, contact Lenny at llibrizzi [at] grownyc [dot] org.
            <br /><br />
            Thank you so much to the 223 gardeners who took the time to participate!
