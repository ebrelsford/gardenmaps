From tomatoes to pumpkins, a group of 8 adults grow all varieties of vegetables.  This garden\ufffds new patio has witnessed countless domino and checker matches between local senior citizens.  The patio is also used for summer weekend barbeques and holiday festivals. Eighteen years ago neighbors came together to turn this small corner lot in East New York into a thriving community farm.  Today the garden boasts harvests of fresh vegetables from tomatoes to collard greens, as well as fresh cherries, pears and flowers.  Membership is mostly made up of senior citizens, many of whom have lived in the neighborhood since they were children.  Last year a new gazebo was built to shelter neighborhood gatherings.  Children from local PS 242 visit the garden to help with clean up activities and to learn about planting vegetables and fruits.
