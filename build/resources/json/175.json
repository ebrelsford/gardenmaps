{"website": "", "council_district": "8", "neighborhood": "East Harlem", "description": "Beautiful natural green space, with grass grounds and many fruit and flowering trees. Most members have vegetable plots and there are communal rose, herb, flower beds. Our garden is unique in that we have so many trees. In summer, the sitting area is shaded by cherry blossom trees and cool. The rose garden produces beautiful roses throughout the growing season. The garden was founded by Rose Gardella, who took an area where several buildings had been destroyed and turned it into a beautiful oasis for the community. PVCG is one of the few gardens that has not been paved over. We have also extra-ordinary bee diversity (3rd highest in the city) and we get many species of migratory birds in the spring.", "private events": ["members only (no non-members can rent garden)", "yes"], "waitlist": "yes", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "chamomile", "chive", "cilantro", "dill", "echinacea", "lavender", "lemongrass", "marjoram", "mint", "oregano", "parsley", "sage", "thyme"], "vegetables": ["beans", "brussell sprouts", "cabbage", "carrot", "cayenne", "corn", "cucumber", "eggplant", "garlic", "haba\u00f1ero", "jalape\u00f1o", "onion", "peas", "potato", "pumpkin", "radish", "scallion", "summer squash", "sweet peppers", "tomato", "turnip"], "trees": ["5 apple", "1 mulberry", "3 peach"], "greens": ["amaranth", "arugula", "chard", "collard", "endive", "kale", "lettuce", "mesclun", "spinach"], "fruits": ["gooseberry", "grape", "raspberry", "strawberry"]}, "food use": ["used by growers"], "community_board": "11", "who composts": "garden members only", "other_plants": ["native plant garden", "ornamental plantings and flowers", "shade trees", "shrubs"], "ownership": "NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation", "address": "342-353 Pleasant Ave. /502 E. 119th  St.", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "english", "borough": "Manhattan", "id": "175", "year_started": "1978", "art": ["mural"], "name": "Pleasant  Village Community  Garden", "open hours": "TR 6pm-8pm, W 7am-9am, F 3pm-8pm, S 9am-6pm, Su 9am-4pm", "structures": ["educational signs", "gazebo/casita", "grill", "pathways", "rainwater catchment system", "raised beds", "seating area", "table(s)", "toolshed"], "previous_use": "abandoned building, leveled buildings.", "works with schools": "yes", "dues": "yes", "perceived edibility": "76-100%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "chain link", "events": ["barbecues", "educational events", "picnics"]}
