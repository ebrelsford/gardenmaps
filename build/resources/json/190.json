Named after the garden's founder, the site contains raised planting beds, where vegetables are grown and harvested by local residents, including an impressive supply of late-season collard greens, peppers, eggplant and tomatoes. The front of the space features a selection of plants, such as butterfly bushes, verbena, Echinacea and St. John's Wort, designed to attract butterflies and other pollinators to the space. In the back of the site, rain barrels collect water for garden maintenance and a large picnic table is used for informal gatherings.", "private events": ["informal", "members and non-members", "reservation & rental fee", "reservation only", "yes"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "chive", "cilantro", "dill", "echinacea", "mint", "parsley", "sage"], "vegetables": ["beans", "broccoli", "cabbage", "cucumber", "eggplant", "garlic", "onion", "peas", "pumpkin", "radish", "summer squash", "sweet peppers", "tomato"], "trees": [], "greens": ["chard", "collard", "kale", "lettuce"], "fruits": []}, "food use": ["donated", "used by growers"], "community_board": "3", "who composts": "garden members & neighborhood residents", "other_plants": ["ornamental plantings and flowers", "shade trees"], "ownership": "NYRP", "address": "327-329 Greene Avenue", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "spanish", "borough": "Brooklyn", "id": "190", "year_started": "1988", "art": [], "name": "Jane Bailey Memorial Garden", "open hours": "", "structures": ["gazebo/casita", "grill", "pathways", "rainwater catchment system", "raised beds", "seating area", "table(s)", "toolshed"], "previous_use": " vacant lot ", "works with schools": "yes", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "51-75%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "iron", "events": ["arts & crafts", "barbecues", "educational events", "movies", "performance", "picnics", "workshops"]}
