{"website": "http://eastfourthstreetgarden.wordpress.com/", "council_district": "39", "neighborhood": "Kensington", "description": "Originally there were houses where the garden is now located, but they were taken by eminent domain and torn down in order to construct the F train subway tunnel that runs under the garden. For years after the tunnel was completed it was an abandoned lot full of garbage. We have an interesting collection of artifacts that have migrated up through the soil over the years.    The garden was originally founded as a Memorial Garden for Veterans by a group of retired servicemen in the neighborhood. We continue our tradition of honoring and supporting U.S. servicemen and women today.    We have a strong composting program in place. We accept dozens of bags of leaves from our neighbors in the fall from to prevent them from ending up in the landfill. During our open hours the garden also accepts day-to-day compost materials from the community - vegetable scraps, egg shells and newspaper to name a few. Email garden.composting@gmail.com if you have any questions about what types of materials we accept. The dedicated local residents of the East Fourth Street Garden Association have tended this site, formerly known as the Windsor Terrace Kensington Veterans Memorial Garden, since they first organized it in 1979. The garden, incorporated in 1981, has come to serve a central role as a gathering place in this community. The East Fourth Street garden has funded its operations and special projects through dues collection, flea markets, and two Mollie Parnis Dress Up Your Neighborhood Awards. In addition, the garden also welcomes visitors for a series of special events and workshops, such as Jazz concerts and Fall Harvest Festivals. See our Events Calendar for more information at http://eastfourthstreetgarden.wordpress.com/calendar/    The Garden serves as the Kensington/Windsor Terrace CSA pickup location on Saturdays at 10:30am during the growing season.
