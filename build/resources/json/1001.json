{"website": "", "council_district": "47", "neighborhood": "Coney Island", "description": "The garden exists on a strip of land, adjacent to the Coney Island Creek. An Eden that allows plenty of room for fruits, vegetables, and plants of many  varieties.  Shrubbery blocks the Garden from street view, and from visibility  from a nearby business establishment.  As the Creek continues to clear, the garden marks a  perfect spot to watch the return of vegetation, fish and animal life to the  region.  It is an unique spot that will be a fine vista for creek and shore visits in the coming  years.
