He and other volunteers cleared away garbage and rubble, and gradually the garden expanded as abandoned buildings around the new garden burned or were torn down. The garden is large and very well planted, with a grape arbor, fish pond, casita, brick pathways and dozens of trees, including cherry, peach and pear trees and a huge weeping willow. It is a community center without walls, providing natural, spiritual and practical support to a diverse neighborhood. Because it is one of the largest and oldest gardens, we have a great diversity of mature trees, making this garden a tranquil and shady spot. It is horticulturally oriented, with many unique and unusual plants, and has been landscaped to offer peace and privacy for visitors.", "private events": ["members and non-members", "reservation & rental fee", "yes"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "chive", "cilantro", "echinacea", "lavender", "mint", "oregano", "parsley", "sage", "thyme"], "vegetables": ["beans", "brussell sprouts", "cucumber", "eggplant", "jalape\u00f1o", "onion", "radish", "summer squash", "sweet peppers", "tomato"], "trees": ["1 apricot", "1 cherry", "1 fig", "1 peach"], "greens": ["amaranth", "arugula", "chard", "collard", "lamb's quarters"], "fruits": ["grape", "hardy kiwi", "rhubarb"]}, "food use": ["donated", "used by growers"], "community_board": "3", "who composts": "garden members only", "other_plants": ["botanical garden", "ornamental plantings and flowers", "shade trees", "shrubs", "water garden"], "ownership": "NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation", "address": "144 Avenue C / 703 E. 9th Street", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "english, portuguese, spanish", "borough": "Manhattan", "id": "33", "year_started": "1977", "art": ["sculpture(s)"], "name": "9th Street Community Garden & Park", "open hours": "F 5pm-9pm, SSu 12pm-6pm", "structures": ["educational signs", "gazebo/casita", "grill", "pathways", "playground", "rainwater catchment system", "raised beds", "seating area", "table(s)", "toolshed"], "previous_use": "abandoned building,  vacant lot", "works with schools": "yes", "dues": "yes", "perceived edibility": "0-25%", "surveyed": true, "water features": ["fish", "other aquatic life", "pond", "water pump"], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "chain link", "events": ["barbecues", "concerts", "educational events", "performance", "picnics", "private events", "workshops"]}
