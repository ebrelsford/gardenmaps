It is used heavily by about thirty members from the surrounding neighborhood, as well as parishioners of the local church.  Community gardeners distribute the produce grown in the garden between all garden members to ensure that each family gets a fair share.  The garden includes Hispanic and Italian immigrant families who share vegetable varieties and growing practices from their homelands.  The garden holds regular barbeques and is open during the day for neighbors and nearby hospital employees to enter to have lunch.", "private events": [], "waitlist": "yes", "food": {"herbs": ["maybe/uncertain", "yes", "yes"], "vegetables": [], "trees": [], "greens": [], "fruits": []}, "food use": [], "community_board": "6", "who composts": "", "other_plants": [], "ownership": "TPL", "address": "2483 Belmont Avenue", "composts currently": "no", "languages_spoken": "", "borough": "Bronx", "id": "26", "year_started": "", "art": [], "name": "Belmont Little Farmers", "open hours": "SAT-SUN:9-5PM", "structures": [], "previous_use": "", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "", "surveyed": false, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "no", "fences": "", "events": []}
