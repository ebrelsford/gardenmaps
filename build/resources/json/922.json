Located on an unbuildable corner lot with a precipitous change in grade, Eagle Avenue group garden contains well maintained decorative plantings of flowers and shrubs, raised beds for growing vegetables, and a casita used as a meeting space. No housing exists on the garden\ufffds side of the block.  The garden serves a small group of neighbors in a semi-industrial area with little access to traditional NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation.  The groups members are almost exclusively Spanish speaking.  Community board one has issued a statement opposing the auction of this garden.", "private events": [], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": [], "vegetables": [], "trees": [], "greens": [], "fruits": []}, "food use": [], "community_board": "1", "who composts": "", "other_plants": [], "ownership": "TPL", "address": "869 Eagle Avenue", "composts currently": "no", "languages_spoken": "spanish", "borough": "Bronx", "id": "922", "year_started": "", "art": [], "name": "Palmas del Caribe (Eagle Avenue Community Garden)", "open hours": "T-Th 1:00pm-5:00pm", "structures": [], "previous_use": "", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "", "surveyed": false, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "no", "fences": "", "events": []}
