{"website": "", "council_district": "21", "neighborhood": "Corona", "description": "The garden is located in a residential neighborhood, which was formerly a vacant lot for many years with much debris. The garden is situated on a narrow plot - 25 x 100 ft. Gardeners have raised beds in the center of the plot and regular beds on either side of the garden. It took at least two years to make the soil ready and viable for a growing garden. Gardeners are members of the 96-104th Streets Block Association and they all live in the Corona communities. They love their garden and love to grow vegetables. Gardeners offer tours during the growing season. They also have Open House, plan the menu for refreshments which are available free of charge to visitors, block association members and friends, and people passing by. Garden is open until Oct 31st.
