{"website": "", "council_district": "8", "neighborhood": "East Harlem", "description": "The Magic Garden (TMG) was established in 1994 by Linda Roman. Tired of seeing her community with empty lots of garbage, Roman decided to make a difference by building beautiful gardens. Thirteen years later she has created three lovely gardens that beautify Spanish Harlem. TMD produces organic cabbage, tomatoes, fresh mint, eggplant, in the summer. Roses, lilies, sunflowers and many other plant life grow plentifully, adding colour to the neighbourhood. There are two casitas for the people of the community to sit, relax and enjoy this gorgeous site. A mural of the Puerto Rican flag, el Coqui and El Morro's castle adds a stunning feel to this urban paradise. Kids from local schools visit TMH to learn about planting and growing fruits and vegetables.", "private events": ["reservation only", "yes"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "cilantro", "mint"], "vegetables": ["cabbage", "eggplant", "jalape\u00f1o", "sweet peppers", "tomato"], "trees": ["1 apricot"], "greens": ["arugula"], "fruits": ["strawberry"]}, "food use": ["donated", "used by growers"], "community_board": "11", "who composts": "", "other_plants": ["shade trees"], "ownership": "HPD", "address": "1665 Park Avenue", "composts currently": "no", "languages_spoken": "english", "borough": "Manhattan", "id": "1180", "year_started": "1992", "art": ["mural"], "name": "Magic Garden", "open hours": "", "structures": ["educational signs", "gazebo/casita", "grill", "pathways", "raised beds", "seating area", "table(s)", "toolshed"], "previous_use": " vacant lot ", "works with schools": "yes", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "26-50%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "no", "fences": "iron", "events": ["educational events", "performance", "picnics", "private events", "workshops"]}
