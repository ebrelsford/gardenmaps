{"website": "", "council_district": "34", "neighborhood": "Bushwick", "description": "The area where this garden is located was just about ground zero for the notorious arson, fires, and looting that swept through the area in the wake of the great New York City blackout of 1977. This is a massive green space adjacent to the elevated Gates Ave. stop on the J Train in Bushwick. It is divided into three distinct spaces: the lower garden is the location for many community events. It has flowers, shrubs, and a newly redesigned casita.  Up a ramp is the 19,000 sq ft \"Secret Garden\" (so called as it is in the middle of the block and hidden from street view). Two-thirds of the space is vegetable garden, one-third is a small forest where the Secret Garden Nature Sanctuary is being developed by a local organization, EcoStation:Bushwick. This unique space is currently under renovation and the site for an innovative bioremediation program initiated by Earth Matter, who have set up a community composting program there (this \"wild\" area had been dumped on for decades by lazy construction crews and thoughtless neighbors).", "private events": ["members and non-members", "yes"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "chive", "cilantro", "sage"], "vegetables": ["beans", "beet", "carrot", "corn", "cucumber", "eggplant", "garlic", "jalape\u00f1o", "onion", "radish", "scallion", "sweet peppers", "tomato"], "trees": ["1 apple"], "greens": ["bok choy", "collard", "kale"], "fruits": ["blackberry", "grape", "watermelon"]}, "food use": ["sold at a market", "used by growers"], "community_board": "4", "who composts": "public", "other_plants": ["ornamental plantings and flowers", "shade trees", "shrubs"], "ownership": "Private", "address": "1327-33 Broadway", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "english", "borough": "Brooklyn", "id": "274", "year_started": "1977", "art": ["mural"], "name": "Linden-Bushwick Block Asociation", "open hours": "T 6pm-8am, SSu 12pm-4pm.
