It is one of the only communally operated gardens in NYC and has a long-standing association with the local Park Slope Food Co-op. Annie's garden is narrow. Garden of Union is one lot removed but they are the same garden. The large garden has a perennial border and mostly annual interior of edibles. One herb bed and two flower beds area also on the interior.
