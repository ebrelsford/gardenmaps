Gorgeous ornamental trees and shrubs, loads of flowers, veggies and herbs galore. Plus a table under a peach tree and benches on a small lawn hidden from the road. Some of the same gardeners have been involved since the 1970s, moving the garden brick by brick and plant by plant from a site across the street that has since been developed to housing. Currently facing another move in the fall; Brooklyn College has promised another space, but possibly not until 2011 or later.
