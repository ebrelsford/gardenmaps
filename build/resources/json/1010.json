{"website": "", "council_district": "33", "neighborhood": "Boerum Hill", "description": "It is a community garden with bushes, ivy, flowers, a Redwood tree, a flowering cherry tree, and an oak tree, which has made the Hoyt Street Garden very shady. We have brick pathways, made from bricks that were in the soil when we created the Garden out of a derelict vacant lot. There are four wooden benches. We do not own the land, but have created and maintained the Garden since 1975. We have FREE Stories in the Garden on the eveneings of the last Tuesday in June and all the Tuesdays in July with volunteer neighborhood readers and FREE refreshments for the families that attend and also for anyone walking by. This creates a great sense  of community and connects many people in the neighborhood.", "private events": ["yes"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": [], "vegetables": [], "trees": ["1 cherry"], "greens": [], "fruits": []}, "food use": [], "community_board": "2", "who composts": "", "other_plants": ["ornamental plantings and flowers", "shade trees", "shrubs"], "ownership": "Private", "address": "100 Hoyt Street", "composts currently": "no", "languages_spoken": "creole, english, spanish", "borough": "Brooklyn", "id": "1010", "year_started": "1975", "art": ["mural", "sculpture(s)"], "name": "Hoyt Street Garden", "open hours": "MTWRF 8am-10am and 5pm-7pm, SSu 4pm-7pm", "structures": ["pathways", "seating area"], "previous_use": " vacant lot ", "works with schools": "yes", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "0-25%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "other (please specify)", "events": ["private events"]}
