This garden started with 3 members from 11 Ten Eyck co-op, it was hard work.  I never thought it was going to turn out to be so beautiful, thats our garden.  Hard work and dedication can produce some amazing results...This garden was HPD subject to develop, but we never gave up, about two years ago it was converted into parks Dept, I would like to thank everyone involve.
