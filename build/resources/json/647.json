For six months, NYRP's horticulture crews and design team worked side-by-side with Hood and local residents to realize the community's vision for the space. Incorporating a children's learning garden, vegetable plots and a patio area, the garden does much to draw the community into the garden and take the garden out into the community. An innovative and wildly creative design makes the property not only a lively, multi-functional gathering space, but also provides gardeners with amenities such as a unique rainwater harvesting system with a 5000 gallon underground tank, composed of 10-foot-tall funnels, which provides regular irrigation, as well as shade for rest and relaxation.", "private events": ["informal", "members and non-members", "reservation & rental fee", "reservation only", "yes"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "dill", "mint", "oregano", "parsley", "sage"], "vegetables": ["beans", "broccoli", "cauliflower", "corn", "cucumber", "eggplant", "onion", "peas", "pumpkin", "radish", "sweet peppers", "tomato"], "trees": ["1 apple", "1 peach"], "greens": ["collard", "kale"], "fruits": ["watermelon"]}, "food use": ["used by growers"], "community_board": "12", "who composts": "garden members & neighborhood residents", "other_plants": ["ornamental plantings and flowers", "shade trees"], "ownership": "NYRP", "address": "117-09 165th Street", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "english", "borough": "Queens", "id": "647", "year_started": "1999", "art": [], "name": "Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson Community Garden", "open hours": "MTWRFSSu 9am-7pm", "structures": ["gazebo/casita", "grill", "pathways", "rainwater catchment system", "raised beds", "seating area", "table(s)", "toolshed"], "previous_use": " vacant lot ", "works with schools": "yes", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "51-75%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "chain link", "events": ["arts & crafts", "barbecues", "concerts", "educational events", "movies", "performance", "picnics", "private events", "workshops"]}
