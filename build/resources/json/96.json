{"website": "", "council_district": "2", "neighborhood": "East Village", "description": "The front of the space features an upland habitat garden. Moving through the site on a reclaimed, white-marble walkway, situated beneath a lush kiwi vine supported by a steel arbor made by Brooklyn artisans, visitors pass both acidic soil and woodland gardens. The back of the space houses a wetland habitat fed by rainwater harvested from the roof of an adjacent building. Benches, also made by Brooklyn artisans from black locust, provide seating throughout the garden, which is fronted by a lot-wide tree pit on the sidewalk that creates a bioswale to decrease the flow of stormwater going into the sewer system. Toyota's gift has allowed NYRP to make substantial capital improvements in the garden, which opened to the public in 2008, including seating areas for outdoor classes; trees, shrubs, and flowers; and planting beds, a tool shed and water storage and composting facilities.
