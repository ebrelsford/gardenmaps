To that end, we recruit volunteer members and offer public access hours and events from April to October annually. Our main focus is edibles. Our garden name honors those who tended the garden in years past, neighbor Carrie McCracken, and TRUCE, an after-school program part of Harlem Children's Zone. Our garden saw dramatic increase in membership during 2009 as we reached out to more neighbors than ever before.", "private events": ["members only (no non-members can rent garden)", "yes"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "chive", "mint", "parsley", "sage"], "vegetables": ["beans", "broccoli", "brussell sprouts", "cabbage", "cayenne", "corn", "cucumber", "eggplant", "garlic", "haba\u00f1ero", "jalape\u00f1o", "onion", "peas", "pumpkin", "summer squash", "sweet peppers", "tomato"], "trees": ["2 apple", "2 apricot", "1 cherry", "1 fig"], "greens": ["collard"], "fruits": ["raspberry", "strawberry"]}, "food use": ["used by growers"], "community_board": "10", "who composts": "garden members only", "other_plants": ["ornamental plantings and flowers", "shade trees"], "ownership": "NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation", "address": "215 W. 117th Street", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "english, french, korean, spanish", "borough": "Manhattan", "id": "776", "year_started": "1993", "art": [], "name": "Carrie McCracken Garden (TRUCE)", "open hours": "SSu 1pm-6pm", "structures": ["grill", "raised beds", "seating area", "table(s)"], "previous_use": "abandoned building,  vacant lot", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "51-75%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "chain link", "events": ["barbecues", "educational events", "performance", "picnics", "workshops"]}
