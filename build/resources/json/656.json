Along the sides there are vegetables with gated fences to keep the plants and our community guests safe so they can roam through the garden freely. Our special features are our barbeque area for summer cooking, and custom-made stage with recycled wood materials, and our prime jewel - our all-wood, natural style gazebo for a relaxed oasis in the middle of our garden.", "private events": ["informal", "yes"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": [], "vegetables": ["beans", "sweet peppers", "tomato"], "trees": [], "greens": ["collard"], "fruits": []}, "food use": ["donated"], "community_board": "4", "who composts": "", "other_plants": ["ornamental plantings and flowers"], "ownership": "NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation", "address": "1420 College Avenue", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "english, spanish", "borough": "Bronx", "id": "656", "year_started": "2003", "art": [], "name": "College Avenue GreenThumb", "open hours": "MTWRF 5pm-7pm, SSu 11am-2pm", "structures": ["gazebo/casita", "grill", "pathways", "raised beds", "seating area", "table(s)", "toolshed"], "previous_use": "abandoned building,  vacant lot", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "0-25%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "chain link", "events": ["arts & crafts", "barbecues", "concerts", "educational events", "performance", "picnics", "workshops"]}
