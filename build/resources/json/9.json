Today the garden boasts harvests of fresh vegetables from tomatoes to collard greens, as well as fresh cherries, pears and flowers.  Membership is mostly made up of senior citizens, many of whom have lived in the neighborhood since they were children.  Last year a new gazebo was built to shelter neighborhood gatherings.  Children from local PS 242 visit the garden to help with clean up activities and to learn about planting vegetables and fruits.
