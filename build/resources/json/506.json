It has 2  murals drawn by the children, lots of vegetable beds, and some shrubs.  The  most unique thing about this garden is that there are ten families, each  coming from a different country, and they all live in harmony.  They involve  many neighborhood children in summertime workshops about gardening and arts & crafts, keeping them busy and preparing them to be the leaders of the future.
