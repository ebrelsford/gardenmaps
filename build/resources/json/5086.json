{"website": "", "council_district": "42", "neighborhood": "", "description": "Currently, approximately 20% of the garden is cultivated with landscape-type perennials and vegetables.  Rainwater is collected in a 1000-gallon tank which was installed during the first season (Summer 2008) by Lenny Librizzi of CENYC.  The water from the roof of Imperial Paper Company is more than enough to supply the garden's watering needs.  GreenThumb installed a greenhouse in 2008 and a storage unit as well.  2009 saw the introduction of a beehive and the first full season for vegetable production.  Expansion to at least double this year's food production is planned for 2010.", "private events": ["no"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "chive", "mint", "sage", "thyme"], "vegetables": ["beans", "cabbage", "eggplant", "pumpkin", "radish", "sweet peppers", "tomato"], "trees": [], "greens": ["chard", "collard", "kale", "lettuce", "spinach"], "fruits": []}, "food use": ["used by growers"], "community_board": "16", "who composts": "garden members only", "other_plants": ["ornamental plantings and flowers"], "ownership": "NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation", "address": "", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "english", "borough": "Brooklyn", "id": "5086", "year_started": "2008", "art": [], "name": "Abib Newborn", "open hours": "MW 9am-12pm, S 8am-12pm", "structures": ["greenhouse or hoop house", "rainwater catchment system", "raised beds", "seating area", "toolshed"], "previous_use": "", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "no", "perceived edibility": "0-25%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "chain link", "events": ["educational events", "workshops"]}
