The St. John\ufffds Rennaisance site (lot 34) had a long term lease with GreenThumb which was not supposed to expire until 2004, however DCAS recently cancelled this lease without explanation or notification to the gardeners.  These two gardens are used for children\ufffds programming and as a playground and ecology learning center for the daycare center located in Ralph Lincoln Service Center\ufffds adjacent building.  This sponsoring organization has purchased one of the two lots making up the Ralph Lincoln Service Center garden, and only one half of the garden (the remaining lot 40) is on the auction.  These two sites have the support of Community Board Eight to remain as permanent community gardens.
