We are situated on 3 acres and have cultivated raised beds on communal plots, growing herbs, native flowering plants, vegetables such as eggplant, peppers, tomatoes, lettuce, basil, spinach, cilantro, beans, and onions! We are trying to unite diverse populations in this industrial strip of Mott Haven to produce healthful food for their households and eventually for a community farmers' market. We hosted numerous school groups and student volunteer organizations in our first growing season. This helped to shape a vision to become a teaching farm as well as a community venue for fresh, nutritious food.", "private events": ["no"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "cilantro", "echinacea", "lavender", "lemongrass", "mint", "parsley", "sage"], "vegetables": ["eggplant", "haba\u00f1ero", "jalape\u00f1o", "onion", "scallion", "tomato"], "trees": ["2 apple", "1 pear"], "greens": ["collard", "lettuce", "spinach"], "fruits": []}, "food use": ["donated", "sold at a market", "used by growers"], "community_board": "", "who composts": "garden members only", "other_plants": ["native plant garden", "shade trees"], "ownership": "NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation/MTA", "address": "", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "english, italian, spanish", "borough": "Bronx", "id": "5121", "year_started": "2009", "art": [], "name": "La Finca Del Sur", "open hours": "TFSSu 10am-6pm", "structures": ["grill", "pathways", "raised beds", "table(s)", "toolshed"], "previous_use": "  ", "works with schools": "yes", "dues": "yes", "perceived edibility": "76-100%", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "chain link", "events": ["arts & crafts", "barbecues", "educational events", "performance", "workshops"]}
