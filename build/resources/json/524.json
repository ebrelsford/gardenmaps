I always grow the cotton plant - every July when it's very hot, the plant grows when planted where it gets full sun. In late Sept. school children visit two or three times a week - their teacher gives them homework about what they saw in the garden. One school, Boy's Harbor, located on 120th Street and Manhattan I always give them the cotton to take to their classroom!", "private events": [], "waitlist": "yes", "food": {"herbs": ["currently composts"], "vegetables": [], "trees": [], "greens": [], "fruits": []}, "food use": [], "community_board": "3", "who composts": "", "other_plants": ["plans to compost in the future"], "ownership": "NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation", "address": "350-54 E. 4th Street", "composts currently": "no", "languages_spoken": "english", "borough": "Manhattan", "id": "524", "year_started": "1989", "art": [], "name": "Orchard Alley", "open hours": "MWF 11am-6pm", "structures": [], "previous_use": "abandoned building  ", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "yes", "perceived edibility": "", "surveyed": true, "water features": [], "volunteers needed": "no", "fences": "", "events": []}
