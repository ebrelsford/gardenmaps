{"website": "", "council_district": "41", "neighborhood": "Brownsville", "description": "Fantasy Garden is a community based and open green space that is located in the heart of an urban neighborhood in New York City that is known as Brownsville, Brooklyn. This open green space contains a myriad of trees (including apples, cherries, peaches, nectarines, and plums), as well as golden raspberries, five types of grapes, herbs, shrubs, and other plant material. All of the above exist in a park-like setting. The garden serves as a sanctuary for our resident ducks and guineafowl (Freckles) and also other wildlife. This sanctuary helps to protect the community from exposure to airborne toxins and chemicals. It is also a learning center that is used to educate the public regarding the importance of trees and open green for the well-being of a community. Fantasy Garden has more to offer the community and society than just a place for children to play or residents to socialize. We offer a healthy, chemical-free oasis that is essential to the growth and preservation of Brownsville, Brooklyn and all of the residents; most importantly our future generations.", "private events": ["no"], "waitlist": "no", "food": {"herbs": ["basil", "cilantro", "echinacea", "lavender", "marjoram", "mint", "oregano", "sage", "thyme"], "vegetables": ["beans", "cayenne", "corn", "cucumber", "eggplant", "jalape\u00f1o", "onion", "potato", "scallion", "summer squash", "sweet peppers", "tomato"], "trees": ["4 apple", "3 cherry", "1 fig", "3 peach", "1 plum"], "greens": ["arugula", "collard", "kale", "lettuce", "spinach"], "fruits": ["cantaloupe", "grape"]}, "food use": ["used by growers"], "community_board": "16", "who composts": "garden members only", "other_plants": ["botanical garden", "ornamental plantings and flowers", "shade trees", "shrubs"], "ownership": "NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation", "address": "181 Legion Street", "composts currently": "yes", "languages_spoken": "english", "borough": "Brooklyn", "id": "780", "year_started": "1992", "art": ["mural"], "name": "Fantasy Garden", "open hours": "MTWRFSSu 8am-6pm", "structures": ["educational signs", "gazebo/casita", "grill", "pathways", "rainwater catchment system", "raised beds", "seating area", "table(s)"], "previous_use": " vacant lot ", "works with schools": "no", "dues": "yes", "perceived edibility": "26-50%", "surveyed": true, "water features": ["pond"], "volunteers needed": "yes", "fences": "chain link", "events": ["arts & crafts", "barbecues", "picnics", "workshops"]}
