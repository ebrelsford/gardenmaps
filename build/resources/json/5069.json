{"website": "http://www.added-value.org", "council_district": "38", "neighborhood": "Red Hook", "description": "In the spring of 2001, Added Value convened a group of local youth, neighborhood leaders, community based organizations and regional institutions to form our Community Advisory Committee (CAC). Guided through a participatory planning process by Heifer International, the Committee developed a vision and outlined a plan to address food insecurity, unemployment, and the alienation of youth from the Red Hook community. Since then, we have developed a youth lead movement for local food security, opened two farmers' markets, an urban CSA, and developed a 2.75 acre farm in Red Hook and piloted a number of Food and Farm Based Learning Initiatives (FFBL). In August 2003, Added Value partnered with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation to transform an entire city block from a dilapidated playground into a center for urban agriculture. Now Red Hook Community Farm is a vibrant community resource where young and old work, study and grow together as they sow, nurture and harvest plants on a 2.75 acre urban farm. It is an intergenerational community space that serves as an experiential educational environment for youth, adults and our senior citizens. It provides sustenance to residents, creates meaningful work for neighborhood teens, generates thousands of dollars of economic activity and improves community food security. Since opening Red Hook Community Farm (RHCF) in 2005 we have worked closely with our local elementary schools, Public School 27 (PS27), the Brooklyn New School (BNS) and Public School 15 (PS15), to first pilot, then implement a number of FFBLs including our Farm-To-Classroom program and our Seed-to-Salad projects.
